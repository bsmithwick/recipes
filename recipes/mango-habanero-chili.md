# Mango Habanero Chili

*This recipe was largely swiped from Pamela at the unfortunately named [My Man's Belly](http://mymansbelly.com/2013/01/08/the-other-white-chicken-chili-habenero-mango-chicken-chili-recipe/), who in turn had gotten it from some defunct chili place in Encino because her dog liked it.  Whatever, it's good chili.*

**NOTE:** This recipe takes **forever** to cook.  I have done the first 6 hours one day, then separated the chicken from the broth, cooled both, stuck them in the fridge overnight, and finished cooking the next day.

It also uses a surprisingly large number of really hot peppers without the finished product being all that spicy.  Most of the heat from the peppers will cook off, so you're just left with the flavor, but you could easily add in a few more habaneros (or put them in later in the cooking process) to jack the heat up.

### First you will make some hot sauce

#### Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 cup mango chunks
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 habenero peppers, stems removed and roughly chopped
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup sugar

#### Instructions:
1. Heat the vegetable oil to medium high in a skillet.
1. Toss in the mango, onions, and habaneros and cook until the onion is soft (5 minutes or so), stirring occasionally.
1. Add in the lemon juice, ketchup, and sugar.  Stir and continue cooking until it thickens (another 5 minutes-ish).
1. Let the mixture cool a little, then toss it in a blender and blend until smooth.

### Now for the chicken

#### Ingredients:
* 4 cups mango chunks
* 3 lbs chicken breasts
* 2 onions, chopped into big-ish chunks
* 4 garlic cloves
* Half of one of those little cans of tomato paste (you'll just throw other half away.  Sorry.)
* 2-3 habanero peppers, stems removed and finely chopped
* 1-2 serrano peppers, stems removed finely chopped
* 2 cups or so of beef stock
* 1-2 16 oz cans of white beans
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 small can diced green chiles
* 1/3 cup chopped cilantro
* A bit of powdered cayenne pepper (optional)
* A few sprinkles of ghost pepper salt (optional)
* Salt to taste

#### Instructions:
1. Rinse and dry the chicken breasts.  Rub them with something yummy, like a garlic powder rub or a pepper spice rub (or both!)
1. Put the chicken, mango chunks, onions, garlic cloves, tomato paste, 1 each of the habanero and serrano peppers, and the beef stock into a slow cooker.  You want enough beef stock to more or less cover the chicken.  
1. Dump the hot sauce on top and stir it all up.
1. Put the slow cooker on low heat and go do something else for 6 hours or so.
1. Once everything is all cooked and mushy, grab a couple of forks and shred the chicken.  Mash up the mangos with the forks while you're at it.
1. Toss in a can or two of beans, depending on your preference for legumes.
1. Stir in the green chiles, cumin, and brown sugar.
1. Cook for 30 minutes or so, then taste and adjust the seasonings.
1. If you want more heat, add the remaining habanero and serrano peppers.  The earlier you add the peppers, the more their heat will cook off, so save some peppers for the end if you want them to be more potent.  Add in the cayenne and/or ghost peppers as your palate will allow.
1. Cook for another hour or so.  Somewhere near the end, add in the chopped cilantro.
