# Mango Habanero Chili

*This recipe was largely swiped from Pamela at the unfortunately named [My Man's Belly](http://mymansbelly.com/2013/01/08/the-other-white-chicken-chili-habenero-mango-chicken-chili-recipe/), who in turn had gotten it from some defunct chili place in Encino because her dog liked it.  Whatever, it's good chili.*

First you will make some hot sauce.

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 cup mango chunks
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 habenero chilis, stems removed and roughly chopped
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup sugar


1. Heat the vegetable oil to medium high in a skillet.
2. Toss in the mango, onions, and habaneros and cook until the onion is soft (5 minutes or so), stirring occasionally.
3. Add in the lemon juice, ketchup, and sugar.  Stir and continue cooking until it thickens (another 5 minutes-ish).
4. Put the mixture in a the nice tall cup you got with your immersion blender and blend until smooth.  What do you mean you don't have an immersion blender?  Go get one.  Or put the mixture in a regular ol' bender and mix it in there.
